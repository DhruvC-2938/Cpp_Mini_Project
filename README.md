# 🏨 Hotel Booking System (C++)

## 📌 Project Description
The **Hotel Booking System** is a menu-driven, console-based C++ application that simulates basic hotel room management operations.  
It allows users to book rooms, calculate bills with tax, checkout guests, and view occupied rooms.

This project demonstrates practical usage of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts in C++ and is suitable for academic mini projects.

  - Number of nights
- Automatic bill calculation with 10% tax
- Guest checkout functionality
- View currently occupied rooms
- Simple and interactive menu system

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** C++
- **Platform:** Console / Terminal

### Core Concepts Applied
- Classes and Objects
- Encapsulation (private data members)
- Abstraction (public methods)
- Arrays
- Loops and conditional statements

---

## 🧠 OOP Concepts Explained
- **Class (`Hotel`)**  
  Represents the hotel and manages room details, pricing, availability, and billing.

- **Object (`h`)**  
  An instance of the `Hotel` class used to access booking and checkout operations.

- **Encapsulation**  
  Room data such as price, availability, and occupied rooms are kept private and accessed only through class methods.

- **Abstraction**  
  Users interact with the system using menu options without knowing internal data handling.
